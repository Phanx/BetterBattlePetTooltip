Description
---------------

BetterBattlePetTooltip modifies the "Collected" lines in battle pet
tooltips. It supports item tooltips for caged battle pets, unit tooltips
for wild battle pets, and minimap tracking tooltips.

The default "Collected (1/3)" text is changed to "Collected (Level 25)",
to indicate the level of your collected pet, and both the text and the
tooltip border are colored by the rarity of your collected pet.

Colorblind users will be shown the rarity name (eg. "Rare") at the end
of the info line, and the text won't be colored.

When mousing over a wild battle pet unit you have already battled this
login session, an additional line in the tooltip will show the pet's
quality. This only works for unit tooltips (not the tracking tooltips
on the minimap) and only works for the exact pet you battled (not for
other pets of the same type).


Usage
---------

Type “/bbpt” to open the options pane, or browse to it in the game’s

You can toggle the display of quantities, levels, or previously seen
wild pet qualities.
