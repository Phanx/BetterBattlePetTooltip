
  BetterBattlePetTooltip
  A World of Warcraft user interface addon
  Copyright (c) 2012 Akkorian, Phanx

  Description
  ===============

  BetterBattlePetTooltip modifies wild battle pet tooltips to show
  the highest level and best quality you’ve collected of that pet, and
  colors the tooltip border by your best quality.

  It also modifies caged battle pet tooltips to show the highest level
  and best quality you’ve collected of that pet, and colors the tooltip
  border by the quality of the caged pet.

  Please note that this addon *does not* show you the actual quality of
  wild battle pets, as that information is not available until you are
  in a battle with the pet.

  Usage
  =========

  Type “/bbpt” to open the options pane, or browse to it in the game’s
  Interface Options window.

  Users with the game’s Colorblind Mode enabled will see pet qualities
  as text (eg. Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare) instead of color.

  Language Support
  ====================

  BetterBattlePetTooltip is compatible with all game localizations.

  The options are translated into English. If you have translations for
  another language, post a comment on the download page.
