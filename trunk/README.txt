  Description
  ===============

  Better Battle Pet Tooltip shows your highest collected level and best
  collected quality in battle pet tooltips. It supports item tooltips
  for caged battle pets, unit tooltips for wild battle pets, and minimap
  tracking tooltips.

  The default "Collected (N/N)" text is changed to "Collected (N/N)
  (Level N)" both the text and the tooltip border are colored by your
  best collected quality. You can optionally hide the counts and/or
  levels. Users with the game's Colorblind Mode enabled will be shown
  the quality name (Poor, Rare, etc.) instead of the coloring.

  Please note that this addon does not show you the actual quality of
  wild battle pets you are not currently battling, as that information
  is simply not available to addons.
